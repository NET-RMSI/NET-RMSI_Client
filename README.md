# NET-RMSI_Client
 
NET-RMSI_Client is the serverside application for the NET-RMSI project.

Built to run on microcontrollers with limited flash storage such as the Espressif ESP32, the main purpose of this program is to provide a controller client for a NET-RMSI_Server allowing remote control of a connected server or computer without physical access.

Documentation for NET-RMSI_Srv_Py can be in the [Wiki](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/wiki) section of this repository.

***

Branch layout is as follows:
* [dev](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/dev/) - Development branch, features are added often in stages and are not always fully functional as they get worked on, therefore making dev unsuitable for production.
* [stable](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/stable/) - Current stable version of the software.
* [bleeding-edge](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client/tree/bleeding-edge/) - Newest features with full functionality but may contain bugs.
* version-x.x.x - Legacy versions and codebases.
